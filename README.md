The application uses firebase authentication for registering all new users and also logging all the registered users.
On the front UI for registration and login , It uses google material design which makes the application to have a nice looking UI .
It also uses a Text Watcher which  is a real time validation for validating the user input  data , password confirmation and Email confirmations.
